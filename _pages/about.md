Hi! I am Terry Pei 😊, a PhD student at the University of Sydney. I major in deep learning at the school of computer science.

<!-- **Skills Mastery**: Python, SQL, Git, Latex, Markdown, Google Cloud Platform, Jupyter, Pytorch, Numpy, Matplotlib, C/C++, Scrapy, Flask. -->

**Specialized Field**: Data-centric LLMs with downstream applications. I also have rich experience on  NLP and CV during the industry internship.

**Recent Work**: Update the AI search engine.
